# Getting started

For this project, we are going to be using [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) to generate a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app that uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

# Local development

To develop this application on your machine, you will need to have Docker and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

If you are unfamiliar with Docker, don't panic. You can download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - available for macOS and Windows.

## Create a Next.js app using TypeScript

We will use the latest version of [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) to generate our [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) automatically configured for us:

```sh
$ npx create-next-app app --example with-typescript
```

Let's verify that our app runs by starting Next.js in development mode:

```sh
$ cd app
$ npm run dev
```

Your application should be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) ðŸ¤“
