# Getting started

For this project, we are going to be using [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) to generate a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app that uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

# Local development

To develop this application on your machine, you will need to have Docker and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

If you are unfamiliar with Docker, don't panic. You can download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - available for macOS and Windows.

Quick cheat sheet for working with this Dockerized app:

```sh
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#                     Docker compose cheatsheet                           #
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Created by Rob Brennan <rob@therobbrennan.com>                          #
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Start the application
#   NOTE: This will build new images/containers the first time; otherwise,
#         it will reuse containers if they exist.
$ docker-compose up

# Start the application after a fresh build of new images and containers
$ docker-compose up --build

# Stop the application
#   NOTE: This stops Docker services/containers for this application but
#         does NOT destroy or remove them
$ docker-compose stop

# Remove stopped service containers and any anonymous volumes
# that are attached to the containers
$ docker-compose rm -f -v

# Remove all unused containers, networks, volumes, and images not referenced
# by any containers
$ docker system prune -f --volumes && docker image prune -a -f
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
```

### Scripts

This project also contains several scripts to simplify developing your application.

The following scripts are in `package.json` for convenience:

- `analyze` - This builds the Next.js application and generates two visual representations to explore and view the bundle sizes of the client application and server-side application
- `start` - This launches the Dockerized application - all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml` - and can be enhanced to launch additional services as desired.
- `start:clean` - This starts the entire Dockerized application - all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml` - with freshly built Docker images
- `stop` - This stops all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml`
- `destroy` - This removes all stopped containers (services) as defined in `./docker-compose.yml`
- `destroy:global` - **WARNING: This removes all unused Docker containers, networks, volumes, and images not referenced by any containers on your system - including those that may have been created in other projects. Be careful!**
- `test` - This runs all of the tests
- `test:ci` - This is useful when running Jest within a CI environment. See [https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--ci](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--ci)
- `test:coverage` - This runs all of the tests and generates a code coverage report that is output to the terminal
- `test:coverage:view` - This runs all of the tests and automatically launces the default browser to display an interactive code coverage report
- `test:verbose` - This runs all of the tests and displays individual results of each test. See [https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--verbose](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--verbose)
- `test:watch` - This runs Jest in watch mode and will re-run appropriate tests when files are changed. See [https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--watch](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--watch)
- `test:watchAll` - This runs Jest in watch mode and will re-run ALL tests when files are changed - useful when running the Jest test runner within a Docker container, for example. See [https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--watchall](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--watchall)

# Create a Next.js app using TypeScript

We will use the latest version of [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) to generate our [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) automatically configured for us:

```sh
$ npx create-next-app app --example with-typescript
```

Let's verify that our app runs by starting Next.js in development mode:

```sh
$ cd app
$ npm run dev
```

Your application should be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) ðŸ¤“

## Environment variables

Please copy `./app/.env.local.sample` to `./app/.env` and then define the appropriate environment variables.

```sh
# You must use NEXT_PUBLIC_ as a prefix if you'd like to make environment variables explicitly available to the web browser in a Next.js application
# https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser
NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO=
```

## Testing

Our test environment uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).

In general, tests should be as close to their original files as possible. The exception to this would be files that exist in the `pages` directory.

We do not want our tests appearing as routes for our application, so tests for these files should be placed in `__tests__` - following a similar directory structure. Please see the example test for the default page as well as a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) API route for reference.

For global tests, we can also create commonly used mock objects with the `__mocks__` folder.

This application is already configured to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/); however a reference guide has been included in the event you need to do this for other [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications.

If you're looking to set up [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) with a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application, you will need to do the following.

```sh
# Install Jest and Enzyme development dependencies
$ npm i -D @types/enzyme @types/jest enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 jest dotenv

# Create .babelrc
# Create jest.config.js
# Create jest.setup.js
# Add scripts to our Next.js app's package.json
```
