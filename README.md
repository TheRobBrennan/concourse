This project explores working with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org), and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) within a Docker environment for local development.

# Local development

To develop this application on your machine, you will need to have Docker and `docker-compose` installed.

If you are unfamiliar with Docker, don't panic. You can download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - available for macOS and Windows.

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system, you'll be able to run scripts in `package.json` with `npm run <script-name>` - such as `npm run start:clean`

If you don't have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or `npm` installed, you can run the `docker-compose` commands directly. For example, instead of `npm run start:clean`, you would use `docker-compose up --build` instead to start the application.

Once you have started your application:

- The Next.js example is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - If you run `npm run storybook`, the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) application will be available at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) - which is a great tool for visually exploring and interacting with your React components outside of the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application ðŸ¤“
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) will execute all of the E2E tests to verify the app is working as expected
  - These tests can be viewed at [./apps/cypress/cypress/integration](./apps/cypress/cypress/integration)
  - Once your application has started, you will need to run these tests against the Docker container with `npm run test:e2e`.
    - Alternatively, you can also run the end-to-end (E2E) tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) locally with `npm run test:e2e:open` - which will launch the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) test runner and an instance of Google Chrome on your computer. Just make sure that you have installed the modules in `./apps/cypress` by running `npm install` ðŸ¤“

## Testing

We have a variety of tests available in this project:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  - Our unit and integration tests use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).
  - Our end-to-end (E2E) tests use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) and are self-contained within the `apps/cypress` directory

Once you have started your application, you can run both the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) unit and integration tests with `npm run test` - which executes the tests within an already-running [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) Docker container.

The end-to-end (E2E) tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) can be run against the Docker container with `npm run test:e2e` - which will restart the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) container to ensure the latest testing environment is loaded before executing the test suite.

For the best experience, you can also run the end-to-end (E2E) tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) locally with `npm run test:e2e:open` - which will launch the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) test runner and an instance of Google Chrome on your computer.

## Scripts

This project also contains several scripts to simplify developing your application.

The following scripts are in `package.json` for convenience:

- `analyze` - This builds the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application and generates two visual representations to explore and view the bundle sizes of the client application and server-side application
- `start` - This launches the Dockerized application - all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml` - and can be enhanced to launch additional client apps as desired.
- `start:clean` - This starts the entire Dockerized application - all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml` - with freshly built Docker images
- `stop` - This stops all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml`
- `destroy` - This removes all stopped containers (services) as defined in `./docker-compose.yml`
- `destroy:global`
  - **WARNING: This removes all unused Docker containers, networks, volumes, and images not referenced by any containers on your system - including those that may have been created in other projects. Be careful!**
- `storybook` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this script will start the Storybook application within the Next.js Docker container. Your Storybook application will be available at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)
- `storybook:build` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this script will build the static version of the Storybook application within the Next.js Docker container.
- `storybook:publish` - This script will publish the Storybook application to [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/)
  - **WARNING: This script must have your application and its dependencies installed locally in order to run!**
- `test` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this script will run the Next.js tests within the Next.js Docker container.
- `test:coverage` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this script will run the `test:nextjs:coverage` tests within the Next.js Docker container.
- `test:watch` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this script will run the test:nextjs:coverage tests within the Next.js Docker container.
- `test:e2e` - This will launch our end-to-end (E2E) suite of tests; currently consisting of [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tests.
- `test:e2e:flaps` - This will launch our end-to-end (E2E) flap tests; currently `test:e2e:cypress:flaps`
- `test:e2e:cypress` - This will launch [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) locally from your development machine.
- `test:e2e:cypress:flaps` - This will build a fresh [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) service and then run the script to check a single test file for flaps.
- `test:nextjs` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this command will connect to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) container and run the test suite
- `test:nextjs:coverage` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this command will connect to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) container to run the test suite and generate a code coverage report.
- `test:nextjs:watch` - Assuming you have your Docker containers running, this command will connect to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) container to run Jest in --watchAll mode. This will re-run your tests every time a file is changed.

Additional scripts have been created to explore and follow along the official [Create a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) tutorial:

- `nextjs-blog:build` - This stops any running services and destroys containers before performing a fresh build of the project.
- `nextjs-blog:start` - This launches the Dockerized application.
- `nextjs-blog:start:clean` - This starts the entire Dockerized application with freshly built Docker images
- `nextjs-blog:stop` - This stops all services
- `nextjs-blog:destroy` - This removes all stopped containers (services)
- `nextjs-blog:destroy:global` - **WARNING: This removes all unused Docker containers, networks, volumes, and images not referenced by any containers on your system - including those created in other projects. Be careful!**

## SPIKE: Back-end API - Using Hasura Cloud within a local Dockerized environment

This demo is intended to explore using [Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/cloud/) with a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres).

**IMPORTANT** Please be sure to follow the initial setup guide in `__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/README.md`.

You will need to create:

- An Auth0 account with
  - An Auth0 tenant
  - An Auth0 single page application with appropriate callback URLs
  - An Auth0 API
  - Auth0 rules for `hasura-jwt-claim` and `upsert-user`
- Copy `__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/.env.sample` to `__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/.env`
  - `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` needs to be updated to the configuration specific to your Auth0 domain at https://hasura.io/jwt-config/
- Copy `__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/app/.env.example` to `__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/app/.env`
- Use `ngrok` to make your locally running GraphQL API available to the outside world
  - Be sure to update your Auth0 `upsert-user` rule to point to your locally hosted GraphQL API
- Update `__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/app/.env`
  - `GRAPHQL_WEB_ENDPOINT` and `GRAPHQL_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT` need to point to your locally hosted GraphQL API
  - `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` needs to be updated with your defined audience (`https://hasura.io/learn` if you're following the steps in the README)
  - `AUTH0_DOMAIN` will look something like `my-auth0-tenant.us.auth0.com`
  - `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
  - `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Once you have the application started with `npm run hasura-cloud-spike:start`, you will need to run the initial database setup and migration scripts from another terminal window with `npm run hasura-cloud-spike:db:migrate`

The following scripts have been added for working with the demo project exploring [Hasura](https://hasura.io) as a back-end API:

- `hasura-cloud-spike:build` - This stops any running services and destroys containers before performing a fresh build of the project.
- `hasura-cloud-spike:start` - This launches the Dockerized application.
- `hasura-cloud-spike:start:clean` - This starts the entire Dockerized application with freshly built Docker images
- `hasura-cloud-spike:stop` - This stops all services
- `hasura-cloud-spike:db:migrate` - This runs database migration scripts against the Hasura endpoint specified in `__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/config.yaml`

  - After running `hasura:db:migrate`, your Hasura console should look like:
    ![__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/__screenshots__/hasura-console-after-running-db-migrate.png](__reference__/hasura-cloud-spike/__screenshots__/hasura-console-after-running-db-migrate.png)

- `hasura-cloud-spike:destroy` - This removes all stopped containers (services)
- `hasura-cloud-spike:destroy:global` - **WARNING: This removes all unused Docker containers, networks, volumes, and images not referenced by any containers on your system - including those created in other projects. Be careful!**

Once you have started your application:

- The Hasura Console is available at [http://localhost:8080/console](http://localhost:8080/console)
