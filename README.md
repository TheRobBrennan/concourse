This project explores working with [Python](https://www.python.org), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) within a Docker environment for local development.

# Local development

To develop this application on your machine, you will need to have Docker and `docker-compose` installed.

If you are unfamiliar with Docker, don't panic. You can download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - available for macOS and Windows.

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system, you'll be able to run scripts in `package.json` with `npm run <script-name>` - such as `npm run start:clean`

If you don't have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or `npm` installed, you can run the `docker-compose` commands directly. For example, instead of `npm run start:clean`, you would use `docker-compose up --build` instead to start the application.

Once you have started your application, the Python Flask example should be available at [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000) ðŸ¤“

## Docker scripts

This project also contains several scripts to simplify developing your application using Docker.

The following scripts are in `package.json` for convenience:

- `start` - This launches the Dockerized application - all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml` - and can be enhanced to launch additional client apps as desired.
- `start:clean` - This starts the entire Dockerized application - all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml` - with freshly built Docker images
- `stop` - This stops all services defined in `./docker-compose.yml`
- `destroy` - This removes all stopped containers (services) as defined in `./docker-compose.yml`
- `destroy:global` - WARNING: This removes all unused Docker containers and images on your system - including those that may have been created in other projects. Be careful!
